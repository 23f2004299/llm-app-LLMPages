                content: `Ashravan traced the intricate patterns on the lacquered wood of his desk, a motion his old hands would have found familiar. But these hands were not old. They were the strong, steady hands of a man in his prime, the hands Shai had Forged for him. His mind, however, was a tapestry woven from two threads: the faded, frayed memories of an eighty-year-old Imperial Scribe, and the vibrant, sharp recollections Shai had meticulously crafted. The new memories told him he was Ashravan, a master craftsman, a respected elder of the community, a man who had lived a full, satisfying life. The old whispers told him he was a fraud.

He had lived this new life for over a year, his days filled with the pleasant rhythm of carving and polishing. The townspeople treated him with the deference his crafted past demanded. Yet, at night, the ghost of the man he once was haunted his dreams. He would see the Emperor's face, not as the restored, vibrant ruler Shai had presented, but as the near-catatonic shell he had been. He would feel the weight of his own decrepit body, the rasp in his breath.

The climax arrived with a courier bearing the Imperial Seal. A young, officious man with cold eyes entered his workshop. "Master Ashravan," he began, his tone betraying no warmth. "The Frava, the new council, have reviewed the... events of last year. They have questions about the authenticity of certain... restorations."

Ashravan’s blood ran cold. The new memories supplied him with indignation, a sense of wounded pride. The old whispers supplied him with pure, unadulterated terror. He was a forgery, a lie given flesh.

The official slid a simple wooden bird across the desk. "We are told you carved this. A trifle, but your signature piece, they say."

Ashravan looked at the bird. It was unfamiliar. His Forged memories contained no record of it. But his true, eighty-year-old hands remembered the feel of the knife, the curve of the grain. It was a piece he’d carved for his granddaughter decades ago, before his mind began to fray. A piece from the life Shai had erased.

He picked it up. He could deny it, rely on the perfect fabrication of his new identity. Or he could claim it, and embrace the fractured truth of who he was. "Yes," Ashravan said, his voice a low, steady timber that was neither young nor old, but entirely his own. "I made this. Let me tell you how."`
